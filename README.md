### Thinking in Rust, day by day as a beginner.

#### Usage
1. run `cargo install tauri-cli` once
2. start dev with `cargo tauri dev`

#### About Gitlab Personal Access Token
The personal access token is for requesting the GitLab REST API. Follow official
[guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/users/profile/personal_access_tokens/) to create 
one under `Preferences/Access tokens`.

#### Something
This is basically a toy and I built up the frontend with Chatgpt.
